        ***** Finding prime numbers in file ****

TASK:
        1- Find all prime numbers in file 
        2- Give user some info(smallest and biggest prime number)

FILE:
        Name of target file is random_numbers.
        Structure of file is one line-one number.
METHOD:
        Read whole file in memory.

        Remove every '\n' with '\0'

        Bash script will calculate number of cores that CPU has,
                and we will run that number of threads.

        When we find prime number, we will add him into list of prime numbers.
        
        List is singly linked list.
        
        Part of code where we update list is critical section. Only 1 thread can be 
                in Crictical section.
        
        For that reason, I'am going to use semaphores(binary semaphore)

PREREQUISITES:
        - C compiler(gcc)
        - File with random numbers(called random_numbers)
        - chmod +x get_num_of_cores.sh ( before you run ./main )
